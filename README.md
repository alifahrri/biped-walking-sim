trajectory generation and kinematic for bipedal walking

this project is actually my old project back in 2016, demonstrate a custom matrix manipulation, 
trajectory generation and kinematic for bipedal robot, gui stuff (plotting, opengl, etc), and also serial communication   

the trajectory generation and kinematic for bipedal robot is implemented in c++ following a method from the book titled Introduction to Humanoid Robotics by Shuuji Kajita et. al.
